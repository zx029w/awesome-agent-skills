## What Are Agent Skills

Agent Skills are instruction sets, scripts, and resources that AI agents can discover and use to perform specific tasks. Each skill contains a `SKILL.md` file that tells the AI how to use it.

Skills work across multiple platforms:

|Platform   |Global Directory             |Project Directory   |
|-----------|-----------------------------|--------------------|
|Cursor     |`~/.cursor/skills/`          |`.cursor/skills/`   |
|Claude Code|`~/.claude/skills/`          |`.claude/skills/`   |
|Copilot    |`~/.copilot/skills/`         |`.github/skills/`   |
|Windsurf   |`~/.windsurf/skills/`        |`.windsurf/skills/` |
|Codex      |`~/.codex/skills/`           |`.codex/skills/`    |
|OpenCode   |`~/.config/opencode/skills/` |`.opencode/skills/` |
|OpenClaw   |`~/.openclaw/skills/`        |`skills/`           |
